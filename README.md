# Write Your Own Adventure Games
Inspired by the Usborne book of 1983, the original author of this project decided to try and code (and recode) the exemplar game in the book into Python, first following the methdology given as closely as possible, then just using the design and re-coding. 

Following interest, the current project is to use some of the lessons learned to create a whole new thing; a guide to - and exemplar code for - developing an adventure game to be used by novice programmers in school clubs and similar.

Throughout the exemplar code, the workbook, and the whole project the intent is **not** to teach coding, or teach good practise. The *intent* is to have fun. Everything else is a bonus.
